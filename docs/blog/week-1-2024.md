### Week 1 2024
    
### What're we doin'?

## Thursday

We decided to postpone the magnetometer a little bit further, and start focusing on SD-Card functionality, as it heavily ties in with out apps event system. A lot of mystery is clouded within SD-Card stuff, and 
it has proved to be a challenge. We've learned that the former group landed on sdmmc, and had used MCC to generate som drivers to interact with. We will be sticking with this, but really doing a complete 
overhaul of the human-written code, which is one abstraction layer above the drivers. We ended thursday with Brage finding good and testable functions connect to SYS_FS, 
and a good source by microchip on how to use it;
