# Mplab With Harmony

## Introduction

This project utilizes the MPLAB X IDE with the Harmony framework to create a
firmware for the COMPASS avionics system. The Harmony framework is a set of
libraries and drivers that abstracts the hardware of the microcontroller and
provides a set of APIs to interact with the hardware.


## Project Setings

The project settings are located in the `COMPASS-harmony-project.X` folder.
