The goal of this project is to provide a graphics playground, it is meant to be a tool for  
visualising ideas and to generate beautiful but also simple graphics. Target applications are  
visualising mathemathics, physics or engineering problems, though it is not limited to only these  
fields and can be used for anything graphics related. Future goals for this project is to export  
useful graphics in useful formats for plotting, illustrating and animation tasks
